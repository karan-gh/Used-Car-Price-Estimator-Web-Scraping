# Used Car Price Prediction (Nigeria)

## Overview
Welcome to the Used Car Price Prediction project, designed to provide accurate pricing estimates for both foreign and locally used cars in Nigeria. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist car buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the Nigerian automotive market.

## Key Features
- **Data Scraping:** The project employs web scraping techniques to collect comprehensive car pricing data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset undergoes a thorough cleaning process, addressing missing values and treating anomalies.
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
- **Machine Learning:** The XGBoost Regressor algorithm is utilized to build a predictive pricing model, enhancing accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.
- **Deployment:** The project has been successfully deployed, allowing users to interact with the predictive model. Visit the deployed app to experience real-time used car price predictions based on the insights gained from the project.
